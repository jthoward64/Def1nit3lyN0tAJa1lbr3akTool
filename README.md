# Def1nit3lyN0tAJa1lbr3akTool

An incomplete jailbreak tool for iOS 15.7 to iOS 16.5 with experimental support for iOS 16.6 (up to Beta 1); iPhone X. I built it just for fun.

This could not have been possible without kfd, kfund, Dopamine and the jailbreak community.

## How to build

- Run `TRUSTCACHEVERSION=1 make` in every subdirectory of `basebin/` if you are building for iOS 15.7, or run `TRUSTCACHEVERSION=2 make` if you are building for iOS 16.5. 
- Compile the project with Xcode, you might need to download the bootstrap first.
